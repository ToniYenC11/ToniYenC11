## About Me

I am an electronics engineering graduate with an extensive experience in AI Engineering and Software Engineering primarily in python. I am an associate certified Data Engineer who made contributions with the Department of Science adn Technology - Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) working on a cervical cancer detection through a cheap method using acetic acid, to be deployed in far to reach places in the Philippines. I enjoy tackling actual scientific and business problems, not just those that are already tackled through large systems, but even the niche and smaller ones that are often overlooked.

## ðŸ”­ Currently Working 
1. **CervAI**
 - I'll be continuing my work for the Cerv.AI project where instead of object detection, it would be image segmentation for the parts or indicators of cervical cancer.
2. **Real-time public utility vehicles and commute app**
 - Still an idea. I am a hardcore commuter myself and thus, I struggle to find instructions on how to get to place of my choosing via PUV (Jeepney,bus,E-trike)
 - Thus, I want to create a mobile app that does that: detailed route, pricing, and time estimating for my daily commute experience.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation**
2. **AI Agents** - Also includes **Model Context Protocol**, which I plan on to use to automate my own workflows.

## âš¡ Fun fact
- I graduated as **Cum Laude** in my batch, but felt lost after graduation due to my overarching sense of purpose being drowned out by the poor economy and employment opportunities in the Philippines.
- I am also taking an **AWS Re/Start** program that allows me to take the Cloud Practitioner Exam upon completion of requirements.
- I have always been active in leadership roles from my first year up to my last year, finally settling with **Leadereship** as one of my core skills.
- My favorite book is **7 Habits of Highly Effective People** by Stephen Covey. This hsaped my way of looking at leadership and being effective.
